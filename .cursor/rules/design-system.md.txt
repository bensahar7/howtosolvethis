Design System: "Atmospheric Curiosity"
1. Vision & Atmosphere
The Vibe: A high-end, cinematic window into deep-tech solutions. It should feel like a futuristic dashboard or a high-end streaming service (Apple TV+ style).

Core Principle: Depth is created through transparency and blur, never through shadows or solid colors.

2. Visual Tokens (Tailwind)
Background: Fixed full-screen image (/images/earth-hero.jpg) with a bg-black/40 overlay.

Glassmorphism:

Surface: bg-white/5 (Ultra-transparent).

Blur: backdrop-blur-xl (Creates the "frosted glass" look).

Border: border border-white/10 (A sharp, thin hairline edge).

Shadows: STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Do not use shadow-sm, shadow-md, etc.

Corner Radius: rounded-none or rounded-sm. Keep it sharp and professional, avoid the "bubbly" look.

3. Typography (RTL/Hebrew)
Font Family: SF Hebrew (Local) as primary, sans-serif as fallback.

Headlines: * Weight: font-bold.

Tracking: tracking-tighter.

Scale: Use large sizes (text-5xl to text-7xl) for Hero sections.

Body: * Weight: font-normal.

Line Height: leading-relaxed (1.625) to ensure readability in long transcripts.

Direction: Always dir="rtl" for Hebrew text.

4. Component Laws
Guest Photos:

Apply grayscale brightness-75 contrast-125.

On Hover: Transition to grayscale-0 brightness-100 over 400ms.

Buttons:

No solid backgrounds. Use the Glassmorphism token.

Hover effect: A subtle white outer glow (box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255,255,255,0.15)) and a slight scale up (scale-105).

Spacing: Be generous. Use p-12 for cards and gap-24 between major sections.

5. System States (Edge Cases)
Loading State:

Use Skeleton Screens using bg-white/5 and animate-pulse.

Do not use spinning wheels.

- **404 - Lost in Space:** - Keep Earth background + 40% dark overlay.
    - Copy: "עובדים על זה, תכף נשוב."
    - Visual: Central Glassmorphism card with a "Back to Orbit" button.

Center a single Glass card with: "אנחנו עובדים על זה"

Error States:

Use a subtle red tint for borders (border-red-500/30) instead of solid red backgrounds.

## 6. Advanced "Non-Generic" Constraints
* **Layout Opinion:** Strictly avoid symmetric grids. Use a 12-column Swiss grid where content blocks start and end on unexpected columns (e.g., a card spanning from column 2 to 7).
* **Typography as Art:** Large display titles should have a `z-index` that allows them to be partially layered behind glass cards or bleed off the viewport edges.
* **Technical Details (The HUD Look):** Use a secondary Monospace font (like JetBrains Mono) for metadata. Add thin vertical/horizontal reference lines (0.5px white/10) to frame sections, mimicking a technical blueprint.
* **Macro-Animation:** Instead of simple fades, use "mask-reveals" where text slides out from an invisible boundary, creating a high-end motion-graphics feel.
