# Marketing & Growth Skill

## Instructions
- **Conversion (CRO):** The Substack embed is the primary KPI. Position it strategically—typically after the first 3 episodes or as a persistent (but subtle) glassmorphic footer.
- **Social Metadata (SEO):** Ensure every episode page has optimized OpenGraph (OG) tags in Hebrew for LinkedIn and WhatsApp sharing.
- **Retention:** Suggest "Related Episodes" at the end of a transcript to keep users on the site.
- **Copywriting:** Use high-impact, curiosity-driven Hebrew micro-copy for buttons (e.g., "גלו את הפתרון" instead of "קרא עוד").
- **Analytics:** Suggest placement for tracking events (e.g., "Episode Play", "Newsletter Signup") to measure performance.

## When to Use
- Use when building the Newsletter section or Footer.
- Use when configuring SEO, meta tags, or sharing features.
